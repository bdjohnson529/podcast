# Next Steps: Complete Authentication & Database Setup

## What We've Built

✅ **Complete Google SSO Authentication System**
- AuthProvider with session management
- LoginButton component with Google OAuth
- Protected API routes with user session handling
- Database schema with Row Level Security

✅ **Enhanced Podcast Features** 
- Duration slider (1-15 minutes) with dynamic content scaling
- Robust JSON parsing for script generation
- Database-backed episode saving for authenticated users

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Schema

Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy the SQL from database_schema_with_auth.sql and run it in Supabase
```

This creates the `episodes` table with proper RLS policies.

### 2. Configure Google OAuth

Follow the detailed instructions in `GOOGLE_SSO_SETUP.md`:

1. **Google Cloud Console**: Create OAuth credentials
2. **Supabase Dashboard**: Configure Google auth provider  
3. **Environment Variables**: Add client ID/secret

### 3. Test the Complete Flow

1. **Sign In**: Test Google OAuth login
2. **Generate Episode**: Create a podcast episode
3. **Verify Saving**: Check that episodes appear in saved list
4. **Database Check**: Confirm episodes are stored in Supabase

## What Happens After Setup

- **Authenticated Users**: Episodes save to database with user association
- **Anonymous Users**: Episodes save to localStorage only
- **Data Persistence**: User episodes persist across devices and sessions
- **Privacy**: RLS policies ensure users only see their own episodes

## Troubleshooting

If episodes aren't saving:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify Google OAuth setup in Supabase
3. Confirm database schema was deployed
4. Test authentication flow

The app gracefully handles both authenticated and anonymous users, so basic functionality works without authentication.
